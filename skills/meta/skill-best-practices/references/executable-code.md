# Skills with Executable Code

The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, these patterns may not apply.

## Solve, don't punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

### Good example: Handle errors explicitly

```python
def process_file(path):
    """Process a file, creating it if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Create file with default content instead of failing
        print(f"File {path} not found, creating default")
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('')
        return ''
    except PermissionError:
        # Provide alternative instead of failing
        print(f"Cannot access {path}, using default")
        return ''
```

### Bad example: Punt to Claude

```python
def process_file(path):
    # Just fail and let Claude figure it out
    return open(path).read()
```

Configuration parameters should also be justified and documented to avoid "voodoo constants" (Ousterhout's law). If you don't know the right value, how will Claude determine it?

### Self-documenting configuration

```python
# HTTP requests typically complete within 30 seconds
# Longer timeout accounts for slow connections
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30

# Three retries balances reliability vs speed
# Most intermittent failures resolve by the second retry
MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

### Avoid magic numbers

```python
TIMEOUT = 47  # Why 47?
RETRIES = 5   # Why 5?
```

## Provide utility scripts

Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages:

**Benefits of utility scripts**:

- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
- Save time (no code generation required)
- Ensure consistency across uses

**Important distinction**: Make clear in your instructions whether Claude should:

- **Execute the script** (most common): "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields"
- **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): "See `analyze_form.py` for the field extraction algorithm"

For most utility scripts, execution is preferred because it's more reliable and efficient.

### Example utility script documentation

````markdown
## Utility scripts

**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF

```bash
python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json
```

Output format:
```json
{
  "field_name": {"type": "text", "x": 100, "y": 200},
  "signature": {"type": "sig", "x": 150, "y": 500}
}
```

**validate_boxes.py**: Check for overlapping bounding boxes

```bash
python scripts/validate_boxes.py fields.json
# Returns: "OK" or lists conflicts
```

**fill_form.py**: Apply field values to PDF

```bash
python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf
```
````

## Use visual analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them:

````markdown
## Form layout analysis

1. Convert PDF to images:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf
   ```

2. Analyze each page image to identify form fields
3. Claude can see field locations and types visually
````

Claude's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures.

## Create verifiable intermediate outputs

When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes. The "plan-validate-execute" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it.

**Example**: Imagine asking Claude to update 50 form fields in a PDF based on a spreadsheet. Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly.

**Solution**: Use the workflow pattern with an intermediate `changes.json` file that gets validated before applying changes. The workflow becomes: analyze → **create plan file** → **validate plan** → execute → verify.

**Why this pattern works:**

- **Catches errors early**: Validation finds problems before changes are applied
- **Machine-verifiable**: Scripts provide objective verification
- **Reversible planning**: Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals
- **Clear debugging**: Error messages point to specific problems

**When to use**: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

**Implementation tip**: Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like "Field 'signature_date' not found. Available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed" to help Claude fix issues.

## Package dependencies

Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:

- **claude.ai**: Can install packages from npm and PyPI and pull from GitHub repositories
- **Anthropic API**: Has no network access and no runtime package installation

List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available in the code execution tool documentation.
