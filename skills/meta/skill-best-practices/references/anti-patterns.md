# Anti-patterns to Avoid

## Avoid Windows-style paths

Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows:

- ✓ **Good**: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
- ✗ **Avoid**: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style paths cause errors on Unix systems.

## Avoid offering too many options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

````markdown
**Bad example: Too many choices** (confusing):
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image, or..."

**Good example: Provide a default** (with escape hatch):
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."
