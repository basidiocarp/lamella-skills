# Intake Gate Workflow

## Step 0: Adaptive Requirements Gathering

### Critical First Action
**BEFORE analyzing anything**, check if context was provided.

**IF no context provided** (skill invoked without description):
→ **IMMEDIATELY use AskUserQuestion** with:

- header: "Purpose"
- question: "What is the purpose of this prompt?"
- options:
  - "Do" - Execute a task, produce an artifact
  - "Plan" - Create an approach, roadmap, or strategy
  - "Research" - Gather information or understand something
  - "Refine" - Improve an existing research or plan output

After selection, ask: "Describe what you want to accomplish" (they select "Other" to provide free text).

**IF context was provided:**
→ Check if purpose is inferable from keywords:
  - `implement`, `build`, `create`, `fix`, `add`, `refactor` → Do
  - `plan`, `roadmap`, `approach`, `strategy`, `decide`, `phases` → Plan
  - `research`, `understand`, `learn`, `gather`, `analyze`, `explore` → Research
  - `refine`, `improve`, `deepen`, `expand`, `iterate`, `update` → Refine

→ If unclear, ask the Purpose question above as first contextual question
→ If clear, proceed to adaptive_analysis with inferred purpose

### Adaptive Analysis
Extract and infer:

- **Purpose**: Do, Plan, Research, or Refine
- **Topic identifier**: Kebab-case identifier for file naming (e.g., `auth`, `stripe-payments`)
- **Complexity**: Simple vs complex (affects prompt depth)
- **Prompt structure**: Single vs multiple prompts
- **Target** (Refine only): Which existing output to improve

If topic identifier not obvious, ask:
- header: "Topic"
- question: "What topic/feature is this for? (used for file naming)"
- Let user provide via "Other" option
- Enforce kebab-case (convert spaces/underscores to hyphens)

For Refine purpose, also identify target output from `.prompts/*/` to improve.

### Chain Detection
Scan `.prompts/*/` for existing `*-research.md` and `*-plan.md` files.

If found:
1. List them: "Found existing files: auth-research.md (in 001-auth-research/), stripe-plan.md (in 005-stripe-plan/)"
2. Use AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Reference"
   - question: "Should this prompt reference any existing research or plans?"
   - options: List found files + "None"
   - multiSelect: true

Match by topic keyword when possible (e.g., "auth plan" → suggest auth-research.md).

### Contextual Questioning
Generate 2-4 questions using AskUserQuestion based on purpose and gaps.

Load questions from: [question-bank.md](question-bank.md)

Route by purpose:
- Do → artifact type, scope, approach
- Plan → plan purpose, format, constraints
- Research → depth, sources, output format
- Refine → target selection, feedback, preservation

### Decision Gate
After receiving answers, present decision gate using AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready"
- question: "Ready to create the prompt?"
- options:
  - "Proceed" - Create the prompt with current context
  - "Ask more questions" - I have more details to clarify
  - "Let me add context" - I want to provide additional information

Loop until "Proceed" selected.

### Finalization
After "Proceed" selected, state confirmation:

"Creating a {purpose} prompt for: {topic}
Folder: .prompts/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}/
References: {list any chained files}"

Then proceed to generation.

## Step 1: Generate Prompt

Load purpose-specific patterns:
- Do: [do-patterns.md](do-patterns.md)
- Plan: [plan-patterns.md](plan-patterns.md)
- Research: [research-patterns.md](research-patterns.md)
- Refine: [refine-patterns.md](refine-patterns.md)

Load intelligence rules: [intelligence-rules.md](intelligence-rules.md)

### Prompt Structure
All generated prompts include:

1. **Objective**: What to accomplish, why it matters
2. **Context**: Referenced files (@), dynamic context (!)
3. **Requirements**: Specific instructions for the task
4. **Output specification**: Where to save, what structure
5. **Metadata requirements**: For research/plan outputs, specify XML metadata structure
6. **SUMMARY.md requirement**: All prompts must create a SUMMARY.md file
7. **Success criteria**: How to know it worked

For Research and Plan prompts, output must include:
- `<confidence>` - How confident in findings
- `<dependencies>` - What's needed to proceed
- `<open_questions>` - What remains uncertain
- `<assumptions>` - What was assumed

All prompts must create `SUMMARY.md` with:
- **One-liner** - Substantive description of outcome
- **Version** - v1 or iteration info
- **Key Findings** - Actionable takeaways
- **Files Created** - (Do prompts only)
- **Decisions Needed** - What requires user input
- **Blockers** - External impediments
- **Next Step** - Concrete forward action

### File Creation
1. Create folder: `.prompts/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}/`
2. Create `completed/` subfolder
3. Write prompt to: `.prompts/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}.md`
4. Prompt instructs output to: `.prompts/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}/{topic}-{purpose}.md`

## Step 2: Present Decision Tree

After saving prompt(s), present inline (not AskUserQuestion):

### Single Prompt Presentation
```
Prompt created: .prompts/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}/{number}-{topic}-{purpose}.md

What's next?

1. Run prompt now
2. Review/edit prompt first
3. Save for later
4. Other

Choose (1-4): _
```

### Multi-Prompt Presentation
```
Prompts created:
- .prompts/001-auth-research/001-auth-research.md
- .prompts/002-auth-plan/002-auth-plan.md
- .prompts/003-auth-implement/003-auth-implement.md

Detected execution order: Sequential (002 references 001 output, 003 references 002 output)

What's next?

1. Run all prompts (sequential)
2. Review/edit prompts first
3. Save for later
4. Other

Choose (1-4): _
```
