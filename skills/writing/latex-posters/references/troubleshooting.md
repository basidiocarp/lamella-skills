## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### AI-Generated Graphics Mistakes (MOST COMMON)

- ❌ Too many elements in one graphic (10+ items) → Keep to 3-5 max
- ❌ Text too small in AI graphics → Specify "GIANT (100pt+)" or "HUGE (150pt+)"
- ❌ Too much detail in prompts → Use "SIMPLE" and "ONLY X elements"
- ❌ No white space specification → Add "50% white space" to every prompt
- ❌ Complex flowcharts with 8+ steps → Limit to 4-5 steps maximum
- ❌ Comparison charts with 6+ items → Limit to 3 items maximum
- ❌ Key findings with 5+ metrics → Show only top 3

### Fixing Overflow in AI Graphics

If your AI-generated graphics are overflowing or have small text:

1. Add "SIMPLER" or "ONLY 3 elements" to prompt
2. Increase font sizes: "150pt+" instead of "80pt+"
3. Add "60% white space" instead of "50%"
4. Remove sub-details: "NO sub-steps", "NO axis labels", "NO legend"
5. Regenerate with fewer elements

### Design Mistakes

- ❌ Too much text (over 1000 words)
- ❌ Font sizes too small (under 24pt body text)
- ❌ Low-contrast color combinations
- ❌ Cluttered layout with no white space
- ❌ Inconsistent styling across sections
- ❌ Poor quality or pixelated images

### Content Mistakes

- ❌ No clear narrative or message
- ❌ Too many research questions or objectives
- ❌ Overuse of jargon without definitions
- ❌ Results without context or interpretation
- ❌ Missing author contact information

### Technical Mistakes

- ❌ Wrong poster dimensions for conference requirements
- ❌ RGB colors sent to CMYK printer (color shift)
- ❌ Fonts not embedded in PDF
- ❌ File size too large for submission portal
- ❌ QR codes too small or not tested

## Best Practices Checklist

- ✅ Generate SIMPLE AI graphics with 3-5 elements max
- ✅ Use GIANT fonts (100pt+) for key numbers in graphics
- ✅ Specify "50% white space" in every AI prompt
- ✅ Follow conference size specifications exactly
- ✅ Test print at reduced scale before final printing
- ✅ Use high-contrast, accessible color schemes
- ✅ Keep text minimal and highly scannable
- ✅ Include clear contact information and QR codes
- ✅ Proofread carefully (errors are magnified on posters!)

## Package Installation

Ensure required LaTeX packages are installed:

```bash
# For TeX Live (Linux/Mac)
tlmgr install beamerposter tikzposter baposter

# For MiKTeX (Windows)
# Packages typically auto-install on first use

# Additional recommended packages
tlmgr install qrcode graphics xcolor tcolorbox subcaption
```
