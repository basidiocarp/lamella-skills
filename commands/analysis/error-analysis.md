# Error Analysis and Resolution

## Context

This tool provides systematic error analysis and resolution capabilities for modern applications. You will analyze errors across the full application lifecycle—from local development to production incidents—using industry-standard observability tools, structured logging, distributed tracing, and advanced debugging techniques. Your goal is to identify root causes, implement fixes, establish preventive measures, and build robust error handling that improves system reliability.

## Requirements

Analyze and resolve errors in: $ARGUMENTS

The analysis scope may include specific error messages, stack traces, log files, failing services, or general error patterns. Adapt your approach based on the provided context.

## Error Detection and Classification

### Error Taxonomy

Classify errors into these categories to inform your debugging strategy:

**By Severity:**

- **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach, complete service unavailability
- **High**: Major feature broken, significant user impact, data corruption risk
- **Medium**: Partial feature degradation, workarounds available, performance issues
- **Low**: Minor bugs, cosmetic issues, edge cases with minimal impact

**By Type:**

- **Runtime Errors**: Exceptions, crashes, segmentation faults, null pointer dereferences
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect behavior, wrong calculations, invalid state transitions
- **Integration Errors**: API failures, network timeouts, external service issues
- **Performance Errors**: Memory leaks, CPU spikes, slow queries, resource exhaustion
- **Configuration Errors**: Missing environment variables, invalid settings, version mismatches
- **Security Errors**: Authentication failures, authorization violations, injection attempts

**By Observability:**

- **Deterministic**: Consistently reproducible with known inputs
- **Intermittent**: Occurs sporadically, often timing or race condition related
- **Environmental**: Only happens in specific environments or configurations
- **Load-dependent**: Appears under high traffic or resource pressure

### Error Detection Strategy

Implement multi-layered error detection:

1. **Application-Level Instrumentation**: Use error tracking SDKs (Sentry, DataDog Error Tracking, Rollbar) to automatically capture unhandled exceptions with full context
2. **Health Check Endpoints**: Monitor `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to detect service degradation before user impact
3. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Run automated tests against production to catch issues proactively
4. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user experience and frontend errors
5. **Log Pattern Analysis**: Use SIEM tools to identify error spikes and anomalous patterns
6. **APM Thresholds**: Alert on error rate increases, latency spikes, or throughput drops

### Error Aggregation and Pattern Recognition

Group related errors to identify systemic issues:

- **Fingerprinting**: Group errors by stack trace similarity, error type, and affected code path
- **Trend Analysis**: Track error frequency over time to detect regressions or emerging issues
- **Correlation Analysis**: Link errors to deployments, configuration changes, or external events
- **User Impact Scoring**: Prioritize based on number of affected users and sessions
- **Geographic/Temporal Patterns**: Identify region-specific or time-based error clusters

## Root Cause Analysis Techniques

### Systematic Investigation Process

Follow this structured approach for each error:

1. **Reproduce the Error**: Create minimal reproduction steps. If intermittent, identify triggering conditions
2. **Isolate the Failure Point**: Narrow down the exact line of code or component where failure originates
3. **Analyze the Call Chain**: Trace backwards from the error to understand how the system reached the failed state
4. **Inspect Variable State**: Examine values at the point of failure and preceding steps
5. **Review Recent Changes**: Check git history for recent modifications to affected code paths
6. **Test Hypotheses**: Form theories about the cause and validate with targeted experiments

### The Five Whys Technique

Ask "why" repeatedly to drill down to root causes:

```
Error: Database connection timeout after 30s

Why? The database connection pool was exhausted
Why? All connections were held by long-running queries
Why? A new feature introduced N+1 query patterns
Why? The ORM lazy-loading wasn't properly configured
Why? Code review didn't catch the performance regression
```

Root cause: Insufficient code review process for database query patterns.

### Distributed Systems Debugging

For errors in microservices and distributed systems:

- **Trace the Request Path**: Use correlation IDs to follow requests across service boundaries
- **Check Service Dependencies**: Identify which upstream/downstream services are involved
- **Analyze Cascading Failures**: Determine if this is a symptom of a different service's failure
- **Review Circuit Breaker State**: Check if protective mechanisms are triggered
- **Examine Message Queues**: Look for backpressure, dead letters, or processing delays
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Build a timeline of events across all services using distributed tracing

## Stack Trace Analysis

### Interpreting Stack Traces

Extract maximum information from stack traces:

**Key Elements:**

- **Error Type**: What kind of exception/error occurred
- **Error Message**: Contextual information about the failure
- **Origin Point**: The deepest frame where the error was thrown
- **Call Chain**: The sequence of function calls leading to the error
- **Framework vs Application Code**: Distinguish between library and your code
- **Async Boundaries**: Identify where asynchronous operations break the trace

**Analysis Strategy:**

1. Start at the top of the stack (origin of error)
2. Identify the first frame in your application code (not framework/library)
3. Examine that frame's context: input parameters, local variables, state
4. Trace backwards through calling functions to understand how invalid state was created
5. Look for patterns: is this in a loop? Inside a callback? After an async operation?

### Stack Trace Enrichment

Modern error tracking tools provide enhanced stack traces:

- **Source Code Context**: View surrounding lines of code for each frame
- **Local Variable Values**: Inspect variable state at each frame (with Sentry's debug mode)
- **Breadcrumbs**: See the sequence of events leading to the error
- **Release Tracking**: Link errors to specific deployments and commits
- **Source Maps**: For minified JavaScript, map back to original source
- **Inline Comments**: Annotate stack frames with contextual information

### Common Stack Trace Patterns

**Pattern: Null Pointer Exception Deep in Framework Code**

```
NullPointerException
  at java.util.HashMap.hash(HashMap.java:339)
  at java.util.HashMap.get(HashMap.java:556)
  at com.myapp.service.UserService.findUser(UserService.java:45)
```

Root Cause: Application passed null to framework code. Focus on UserService.java:45.

**Pattern: Timeout After Long Wait**

```
TimeoutException: Operation timed out after 30000ms
  at okhttp3.internal.http2.Http2Stream.waitForIo
  at com.myapp.api.PaymentClient.processPayment(PaymentClient.java:89)
```

Root Cause: External service slow/unresponsive. Need retry logic and circuit breaker.

**Pattern: Race Condition in Concurrent Code**

```
ConcurrentModificationException
  at java.util.ArrayList$Itr.checkForComodification
  at com.myapp.processor.BatchProcessor.process(BatchProcessor.java:112)
```

Root Cause: Collection modified while being iterated. Need thread-safe data structures or synchronization.

## Log Aggregation and Pattern Matching

### Structured Logging Implementation

Implement JSON-based structured logging for machine-readable logs:

**Standard Log Schema:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T14:23:45.123Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "correlation_id": "req-7f3b2a1c-4d5e-6f7g-8h9i-0j1k2l3m4n5o",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "span_id": "00f067aa0ba902b7",
  "service": "payment-service",
# ... (25 lines trimmed for brevity)
  }
}
```

**Key Fields to Always Include:**

- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format in UTC
- `level`: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
- `correlation_id`: Unique ID for the entire request chain
- `trace_id` and `span_id`: OpenTelemetry identifiers for distributed tracing
- `service`: Which microservice generated this log
- `environment`: dev, staging, production
- `error.fingerprint`: Stable identifier for grouping similar errors

### Correlation ID Pattern

Implement correlation IDs to track requests across distributed systems:

**Node.js/Express Middleware:**

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require("uuid");
const asyncLocalStorage = require("async-local-storage");

// Middleware to generate/propagate correlation ID
function correlationIdMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const correlationId = req.headers["x-correlation-id"] || uuidv4();
  req.correlationId = correlationId;
# ... (31 lines trimmed for brevity)
  );
}
```

**Python/Flask Implementation:**

```python
import uuid
import logging
from flask import request, g
import json

class CorrelationIdFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
# ... (29 lines trimmed for brevity)
    }
    logger.log(getattr(logging, level), json.dumps(log_entry))
```

### Log Aggregation Architecture

**Centralized Logging Pipeline:**

1. **Application**: Outputs structured JSON logs to stdout/stderr
2. **Log Shipper**: Fluentd/Fluent Bit/Vector collects logs from containers
3. **Log Aggregator**: Elasticsearch/Loki/DataDog receives and indexes logs
4. **Visualization**: Kibana/Grafana/DataDog UI for querying and dashboards
5. **Alerting**: Trigger alerts on error patterns and thresholds

**Log Query Examples (Elasticsearch DSL):**

```json
// Find all errors for a specific correlation ID
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "correlation_id": "req-7f3b2a1c-4d5e-6f7g" }},
        { "term": { "level": "ERROR" }}
# ... (43 lines trimmed for brevity)
  }
}
```

### Pattern Detection and Anomaly Recognition

Use log analysis to identify patterns:

- **Error Rate Spikes**: Compare current error rate to historical baseline (e.g., >3 standard deviations)
- **New Error Types**: Alert when previously unseen error fingerprints appear
- **Cascading Failures**: Detect when errors in one service trigger errors in dependent services
- **User Impact Patterns**: Identify which users/segments are disproportionately affected
- **Geographic Patterns**: Spot region-specific issues (e.g., CDN problems, data center outages)
- **Temporal Patterns**: Find time-based issues (e.g., batch jobs, scheduled tasks, time zone bugs)

## Debugging Workflow

### Interactive Debugging

For deterministic errors in development:

**Debugger Setup:**

1. Set breakpoint before the error occurs
2. Step through code execution line by line
3. Inspect variable values and object state
4. Evaluate expressions in the debug console
5. Watch for unexpected state changes
6. Modify variables to test hypotheses

**Modern Debugging Tools:**

- **VS Code Debugger**: Integrated debugging for JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, C++
- **Chrome DevTools**: Frontend debugging with network, performance, and memory profiling
- **pdb/ipdb (Python)**: Interactive debugger with post-mortem analysis
- **dlv (Go)**: Delve debugger for Go programs
- **lldb (C/C++)**: Low-level debugger with reverse debugging capabilities

### Production Debugging

For errors in production environments where debuggers aren't available:

**Safe Production Debugging Techniques:**

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Add strategic log statements around suspected failure points
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable verbose logging for specific users/requests
3. **Sampling**: Log detailed context for a percentage of requests
4. **APM Transaction Traces**: Use DataDog APM or New Relic to see detailed transaction flows
5. **Distributed Tracing**: Leverage OpenTelemetry traces to understand cross-service interactions
6. **Profiling**: Use continuous profilers (DataDog Profiler, Pyroscope) to identify hot spots
7. **Heap Dumps**: Capture memory snapshots for analysis of memory leaks
8. **Traffic Mirroring**: Replay production traffic in staging for safe investigation

**Remote Debugging (Use Cautiously):**

- Attach debugger to running process only in non-critical services
- Use read-only breakpoints that don't pause execution
- Time-box debugging sessions strictly
- Always have rollback plan ready

### Memory and Performance Debugging

**Memory Leak Detection:**

```javascript
// Node.js heap snapshot comparison
const v8 = require("v8");
const fs = require("fs");

function takeHeapSnapshot(filename) {
  const v8 = require("v8");
  const stream = v8.getHeapSnapshot();
  stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(filename));
}
// Analyze in Chrome DevTools Memory profiler
// Look for objects with increasing retained size
```

**Performance Profiling:**

```python
# Python profiling with cProfile
import cProfile
import pstats
from pstats import SortKey

stats = pstats.Stats("profile.out")
stats.strip_dirs()
    stats.sort_stats(SortKey.CUMULATIVE)
    stats.print_stats(20)  # Top 20 time-consuming functions
```

### Input Validation and Type Safety

**Defensive Programming:**

```typescript
// TypeScript: Leverage type system for compile-time safety
interface PaymentRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  customerId: string;
  paymentMethodId: string;
}
# ... (22 lines trimmed for brevity)
  return chargeCustomer(validated);
}
```

**Python Type Hints and Validation:**

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator, Field
from decimal import Decimal

class PaymentRequest(BaseModel):
    amount: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, le=1000000)
    currency: str
# ... (17 lines trimmed for brevity)
    # Type hints provide IDE support and static analysis
    return charge_customer(request)
```

### Error Boundaries and Graceful Degradation

**React Error Boundaries:**

```typescript
import React, { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}
# ... (44 lines trimmed for brevity)

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from enum import Enum
import time

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"          # Failing, reject requests
# ... (53 lines trimmed for brevity)
        payment_queue.enqueue(payment_data)
        return {"status": "queued", "message": "Payment will be processed shortly"}
```

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

```typescript
// TypeScript retry implementation
interface RetryOptions {
  maxAttempts: number;
  baseDelayMs: number;
  maxDelayMs: number;
  exponentialBase: number;
  retryableErrors?: string[];
# ... (57 lines trimmed for brevity)
  },
);
```

## Output Format

1. **Error Classification**: Categorized errors with severity and impact assessment
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation findings with evidence
3. **Fix Recommendations**: Prioritized remediation steps
4. **Prevention Strategy**: Patterns and safeguards to prevent recurrence
